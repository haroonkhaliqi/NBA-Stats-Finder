Hey! This is a terminal app in ruby designed to interact with the user in the terminal and retrieve NBA statistics from a specific player's info, specific players season average for any given season, a specific game result and more. For an specific stat the application will ask the user for information on who or which game the user is looking to find the stats of and takes the input and makes a request to balldontlie.io to retrieve the specific stats and present the stats to the user. Plenty of tty components was used for this terminal application to help the visual perspective look appealing, such as tty-table, tty-prompt, and tty-box as well as plenty of pastel. I started with simply finding a player, to searching for all the players with the same name, to asking the user to select the correct player and verify with them with their team the player is playing for, then retrieving the data of the player then the process again to find out which specific stats the user wants. This app to full fruition should be able to, find a specific players information, find a specific players season average for any season, find a specific players personal stats for a specific game, find the score of any specific game, find the top player stats for a specific game, and find and display the stats of those who played in a specific game. For use, clone or copy and paste the code from file ballstats.rb and place it in a file on your computer, then in terminal run "ruby your_file_name" and that should start the app, and clear your terminal and welcome you and ask you the prompt of which stats you are looking for! Enjoy!!
